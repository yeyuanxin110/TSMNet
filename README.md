## Abstract
Semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing imagery plays a pivotal role in land use/land cover (LULC) mapping, environmental monitoring, and precision earth observation. Current multi-modal approaches mainly focus on integrating complementary visual modalities (e.g., optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery), yet neglect the incorporating of non-visual textual data – a rich source of knowledge that can bridge semantic gaps between visual patterns and real-world concepts. To address this limitation, we propose TSMNet, a text supervised multi-modal open-vocabulary semantic segmentation network that synergistically integrates textual supervision with visual representation for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Unlike conventional multi-modal segmentation frameworks, TSMNet introduces a dual-branch text encoder to extract both scene-level semantic and object-level label information from various textual data, enabling dynamic cross-modal fusion. These text-derived features dynamically interact with visual embeddings through the proposed text-guided visual semantic fusion module, enabling domain-aware feature refinement and human-interpretable decision-making. Moreover, integrating text opens pathways for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, enabling systems to recognize and classify unseen categories through natural language descriptions, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of predefined class taxonomies. To verify our method, we innovatively construct two new multi-modal datasets, and carry out extensive experiments to make a comprehensive comparison between the proposed method and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation models. Results demonstrate that TSMNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities across diverse geographical and sensor-specific scenarios. This work establishes a new paradigm for explainable remote sensing analysis, demonstrating that textual knowledge integration significantly enhances model generalizability.
